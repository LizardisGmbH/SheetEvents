# SheetEvents

## Introduction

SheetEvents is a Qlik Sense Extension which aims to incorporate sheet event triggers similar to the QlikView  `OnActivateSheet` triggers.

With SheetEvent you can trigger up to 10 events when entering a sheet. Those events are:

* Apply Bookmark
* Clear All Selections
* Clear Selection in Field
* Lock Field
* Select Possible Values
* Select Excluded Values
* Select Alternative Values
* Select and Lock in Field
* Select Value in Field
* Select Multiple Values in Field
* Set Variable Value
* Lock All Selections
* Unlock All Selections



All events will be triggered one after another with an initial delay which can be adjusted.
